  description: md`
Speed reading is definitely not my favorite way to read anything and it's nearly
impossible to consume non-fiction materials with adequate comprehension. Try
learning data structures when only a single word is displayed at a time. Ha!
Since audiobooks are my preferred method for reading Stephen King novels, then
what do I actually use this speed reader for? For training to reduce
subvocalization of course! With enough practice it *might* improve reading speed.`
