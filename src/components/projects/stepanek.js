The [Mattie J.T. Stepanek Peace Garden][1] is the design project that I am most
proud of. When the project manager (aka my boss) at [Slater Associates Inc.][2]
put me on the team for this project, I had never heard of [Mattie J.T.
Stepanek][3]. He handed me one of Mattie's books, "Just Peace: A Message of
Hope". After reading this book and several of Mattie's poems, I understood the
significance of the park.

The creation of this garden was a team effort including a sculptor, landscape
installation team, the city of Rockville, our team at SAInc, and most
importantly, Mattie's mother (plus Mattie's service dog, Micah). [Oprah][4] even gave
a surprise speech at the dedication ceremony (and my boss had to speak directly
after her LOL)! I specifically worked on the construction details, planting
plan, and produced the CAD documents.

Mattie's words have inspired me and I hope this park plays some part in
spreading his message of peace and kindness. If others could find joy in life
the way he did, our world might not be so divided. <q>Peace is possible...</q>
