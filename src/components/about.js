Hi. My name is ${myName} (he/him). I'm a web developer living in Traverse City,
Michigan. It's hard to write an about me thing without the word "I" all over the
place. *I this... I that...* I enjoy traveling, nature, gardens and
architecture. I know! Boring. Those are things almost everybody likes. I hate
ticks! Again, who doesn't hate ticks? ~~They're parasitic spiders that burrow
their entire head into~~ They spread disease.

Despite my [Landscape Architecture education][1], I write more JavaScript than
prose and poetry combined. I colored "The Gray's Anatomy Coloring Book" and read
"The Way Things Work" front to back as a child, so I could probably perform
surgery in an emergency. I'm also a Linux geek with no Windows. jk. I have
thirteen windows so I can see the gardens that I enjoy!
